# Create Your First Generated Connector in Ballerina

Welcome to this guide on creating your first generated connector in Ballerina!

Ballerina is a language built for integration, offering a powerful library ecosystem that supports various protocols and external systems. 

In addition to that, it also provides a flexible platform for developers to easily create, publish, and maintain custom connectors (client SDKs) in Ballerina Central, enabling the entire community to benefit.

In this guide, we’ll walk you through the process of generating your first Ballerina connector based on OpenAPI specifications, the fastest and easiest way to build a connector and start integrating with external services.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:

- Ballerina installed on your system
- An IDE or text editor of your choice
- The OpenAPI specification (in YAML or JSON format) for the API you want to create a connector for

## Preparing for Connector Generation

1. Obtain the OpenAPI specification for your target API
2. Review the OpenAPI specification to understand the available endpoints and data structures
3. Ensure the OpenAPI specification is valid and complete

## Generating the Connector

1. Create a new directory for your project:
   ```
   mkdir my_generated_connector
   cd my_generated_connector
   ```

2. Use the Ballerina OpenAPI tool to generate the connector:
   ```
   bal openapi -i path/to/your/openapi_spec.yaml --mode client -o .
   ```

3. This will generate the following structure:
   ```
   module-ballerinax-myconnector/
   ├── .github/
   │   └── workflows/
   │       ├── CODEOWNERS
   │       └── pull_request_template.md

   │   └── wrapper/
   │       ├── gradle-wrapper.jar
   │       └── gradle-wrapper.properties

   ├── README.md
   ├── build.gradle
   ├── gradle.properties
   ├── gradlew
   ├── gradlew.bat
   └── settings.gradle
   ```

## Customizing the Generated Connector

1. Review the generated files, particularly `client.bal`:
   ```ballerina
   public isolated client class Client {
       final http:Client clientEp;
       // ... (other generated code)

       public isolated function init(string serviceUrl, *http:ClientConfiguration config) returns error? {
           // ... (initialization code)
       }

       // ... (generated remote functions for API operations)
   }
   ```

2. Modify the generated code if necessary:
   - Add custom error handling
   - Implement additional utility functions
   - Adjust data types if needed

## Testing Your Connector

1. Create a `tests` directory in your project
2. Write test cases in a file like `tests/test.bal`:
   ```ballerina
   import ballerina/test;

   @test:Config {}
   function testConnector() returns error? {
       Client connector = check new("https://api.example.com");
       // Test various operations
   }
   ```

3. Run tests using the `bal test` command

## Documenting Your Connector

1. Add API documentation comments to your customized code
2. Create a `Module.md` file in your project root with an overview of your connector
3. Generate API docs using `bal doc`

## Publishing Your Connector

1. Update the `Ballerina.toml` file with appropriate metadata
2. Version your connector
3. Push to a Git repository
4. Optionally, publish to Ballerina Central:
   ```
   bal pack
   bal push
   ```

Congratulations! You've created your first generated Ballerina connector using the OpenAPI tool. This approach allows for rapid development of connectors that accurately reflect the underlying API structure.

Remember to keep your connector up-to-date with any changes in the OpenAPI specification and to test thoroughly, especially after making custom modifications.
